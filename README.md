Time spent: 4 hours
    - 2 hours planning a looking up how to implement certain things
    - 1 hour testing without automation
    - 1 hour writing

Testing
    I manually tested my code which was a mistake as it took way too long even with my planning it was definitly a mistake

Bugs and Issues
    I mis-bugetted my time and wasn't able to implement two required features as well as two required extensions. The features being the get and inventory feature, 
    as well as the extensions of locked doors and and using inventory items on objects in rooms. I did encounter one bug when coding the project when working on the
    Go feature as I am shaky on RE so I just used the string inputs like a list and took the last few letters in the input to create an action, however there was a bug
    where it couldn't tell which place it should go

Extensions:
    Implemented:
        - help: will print out a list of commands and what they do when ever a script is entered incorrectly or mistakenly

    Unimplemented:
        - Locked doors: Would prevent access to a room unless the appropriate inventory items where aquired
        - Use feature: Would be able to use objects from items on rooms in order to get new items or change the state of the room
